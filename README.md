# Design of Graph Visualization Tech
## Design of Graph Visualization Techniques  for Assisting the Learning of Complex Functions, Including Transcendental Functions

## Calculus Exploration Performance Tasks for the 1st Semester of 2024
## Reason For Selection
Within the calculus unit, there is a unit called 'Utilization of Derivatives'. However, the unit for using the derivative has to draw a graph by obtaining the derivative and the second derivative directly, but it was studied to plan and implement a learning assistance system for students.
